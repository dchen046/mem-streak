# Poke-Streak

Poke-Streak is a memory game that challenges your ability to remember the sequence of cards you've previously clicked on. After each click, the cards get shuffled around so that you don't just memorize their placements. If you click on a card that you’ve already clicked before, you lose. The goal is to see how long you can go without repeating any cards. The game features a Pokémon theme, with cards showing Pokémon sprites and their names.
